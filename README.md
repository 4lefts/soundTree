# soundTree
Basic audio visualiser using the maxim library's fft to draw a simple l-system tree, written in processing.

A super simple adaptation of the L-System Tree drawing example in by Dan Shiffman on processing.org
The average spectral power of an audio file is used to draw the tree, with the power being mapped to the length of branches, the extent to which the lengths of subsequent branches are attenuated with each itteration, and the angle which the drawing is rotated left and righ each time.
